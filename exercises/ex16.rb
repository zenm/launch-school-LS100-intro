# Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
# My attempt
# b = []
# a.each do |words|
#   b << words.split(" ")
# end

# c = b.flatten
# p c

# the solution didn't create any more variables
a = a.map { |pairs| pairs.split }
a = a.flatten
p a
